		<h2>Who does the accreditation? </h2>
		<p>The accreditation for our therapists and case manager comes from an organisation in Western Australia called Intervention Services for Autism and Developmental Delay (<a href="http://www.isadd.org/" target="_blank">ISADD</a>). Their accreditation is vital to the quality and credibility of the service which our families receive.</p>
		<p>ISADD has a network of psychologists and case managers who supervise programs. They are widely connected to therapists and volunteers. Case managers and therapists are also based in cities throughout New Zealand, including Dunedin. </p>
