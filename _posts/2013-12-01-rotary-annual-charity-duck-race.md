The Otago Children’s Autism Support Group has once again been chosen by the Dunedin East Rotary Club as an official participant in the [Duck Race fundraising event][1] on Sunday February 9.

The Trust members need to sell 1000 tickets (which is a big task for our 10 families). Please help to support us by buying a ticket for $5, or even a book for $25. 

Please share to your friends and family so we can get all of our tickets sold and receive the guaranteed $5,000 that will go towards supporting the children’s programmes.
