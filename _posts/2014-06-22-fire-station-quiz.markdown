We are running are [annual fundraising quiz][quiz] at the awesome Dunedin Central Fire Station again this year. The date is Thursday 14 August, 7pm (questions begin 7.30). Please __pre-register your team by emailing [mel@chopchop.co.nz][mel]__.

Hope to see you there! There is __no EFTPOS__, so please bring along some cash. There is a good bar and there should be decent prizes again, as the usual hard-working volunteer parents have been putting in heaps of work.

There will be a light supper provided. Thanks to the Dunedin Fire Station Social Club! __Enter at the rear of the Central Fire Station__ (off Leith St).
