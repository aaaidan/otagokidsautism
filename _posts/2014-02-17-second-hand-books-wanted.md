The Autism Trust is running a stall at the **Dunedin Farmers Market on the 12th April**, raising funds by selling books. We are looking to get as many decent quality books as possible. Is it time for a clean-out on your shelves? Please get in touch if you have something to donate.

Or, if itâ€™s convenient for you, please drop the books off between 9-5pm any day of the week at **Switch Accounting, 235 Moray Place** (opposite Dunedin Public Library).
