		<li>The charitable trust was set up in 2004. We rely mostly on <a href="/funding.html">grants, donations and our fundraising</a> to pay for therapistsâ€™ wages and training, and for education for parents, teachers and the community.</li> 
		<li> The trust focuses on raising funds for <a href="/introABA_therapy.html" target="_parent">Applied Behavioural Analysis (ABA) therapy</a>.  This involves targeted individual learning programmes, and one-on-one teaching in the home, and also in school. Therapy hours are flexible and able to meet the requirements of the child and family. </li> 
		<li> We have <a href="/therapists.html">great therapists</a> who are terrific with the kids. The therapists are trained and assessed regularly under the umbrella of our service provider, Intervention Services for Autism and Developmental Delay (ISADD). </li> 
		<li> <a href="/profiles.html">Our children</a> range from pre-school to school age.</li> 
		<li> While ABA is government funded in some countries, it is not yet publicly funded in New Zealand.</li>
