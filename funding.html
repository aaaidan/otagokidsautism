		<h2>How funding works</h2> 
		<p> In New Zealand, ABA therapy is not funded by the government. The funding that our trust receives for therapy and case management ensures that the children get excellent and crucial developmental support that is targeted to the individual needs of the child. </p> 
		<p> Our members are well aware of the financial strain of privately-funded interventions. We try to alleviate financial pressure as much as possible. Our fundraising initiatives include an annual magic show, cutting and selling firewood, a Wacky Hair Day for schools in Autism Awareness Week, selling raffles and pens, and sausage sizzles. </p> 
		<p> Our trust also applies to charitable trusts and foundations for assistance in meeting therapy and case management costs for each child. We cannot guarantee full funding for each child, but we work hard to provide a significant portion of the cost. The families involved are encouraged to put some money aside to contribute to therapy when funds are unavailable from the trust. </p>

		<p>In the past year, our costs have doubled to $10,000 per month, and funding is getting harder to find. We are always searching for more organisations who are able to contribute in some way. </p> 
		<p> Children on the autism spectrum have the ability to learn and interact, and ABA helps develop the skills to enable each child to reach their full potential. It is difficult for parents who want the best for their child yet are crippled by the financial burden. If you or your organisation can make a donation and help improve this situation, please either contact us or use the button below.</p>
