        <li> <span class="bold-orange">Emma &amp; Simon Parks </span>- Alex has been on an ABA programme for six hours each week
since 2006. He is now completely unassisted at school, has a network of friends and is an outgoing, fun-loving child.</li> 
        <li><span class="bold-orange">Rachel &amp; Peter Mortimer </span>- Riley had ABA from when he was 2 ¾ until he went to school. He lost all the classic autism symptoms such as flapping, spinning wheels and intense tantrums and instead, became a happy, responsive little boy that we could enjoy. He is achieving success at school without any interventions. He responds well in the classroom and it takes time to notice that he is actually on the spectrum. We are using therapy again in the form of social and emotional communication as Riley approaches 9 years, and we are appreciative of the support we get throughout the life stages of our son.</li> 
        <li><span class="bold-orange">Melanie Stevenson &amp; Alex Gilks </span>- Seven years of ABA therapy has significantly helped
George learn to communicate better and more readily, and develop much better motor and social skills.
And it has helped vastly with managing his anxiety. He’s a happier
boy who can go places and adapt to siutations more easily.</li> 
        <li> <span class="bold-orange">Antonie &amp; Lee Vandervis </span>- We tried many other therapies here and overseas, but the only thing that has worked for Lukas has been ABA. The consistency of the programme ensures that he works on his learning goals until they are achieved. ABA has also helped us as parents to deal with behavioural issues and to provide Lukas with structures in his daily routines that he needs to progress in his development.</li>

        <li><span class="bold-orange">Lynlee &amp; Walter von Ballmoos </span>- Our two boys both have ASD. Reagan was born in April 2000, was diagnosed at three. We used an intensive ABA program until he started mainstream school. He now requires very little assistance and fits in really well with his peers (a social butterfly), is gaining confidence every year and we can see a bright future for him.
<br>Hayden was born in December 2001, was diagnosed at two years, eight months. Hayden is non-verbal and has severe autism. Up until a few months ago Hayden was at mainstream school, but unfortunately he was not coping with the busy environment of a classroom. Hayden now attends Sara Cohen school, and with the assistance of ABA teaching him life skills he is coping a lot better. We don’t believe our boys would be in these positions without the assistance of their ABA programmes.</li> 
        <li><span class="bold-orange">Nicola &amp; Kerry Herbert </span>- 10 years on from our son’s diagnosis, Ryan attends a local Dunedin intermediate school unaided, and enjoys taking part in class and some external activities. Ryan no longer fits the diagnostic criteria for autism as diagnosed by a local clinical physiologist after 8 years of ABA therapy.In her words, we put this down to the tremendous effort put in by Ryan, our family, his therapists and support network of the ABA programme he was taking part in. Although Ryan still works on some anxiety issues, he has not lost his thoughtful and humorous nature and continues to be a very caring boy. We still see a huge light at the end of a very long tunnel we once found ourselves facing.</li> 
        <li><span class="bold-orange">Alena &amp; Justin </span>- Toby has received a reducing amount of ABA over the past 2.5 years, as he has developed his communication, cognitive and social skills. Toby is a happy and intelligent boy who is interested in the world around him.  We are scared to think what life would be like for Toby, and our family, had we not provided him with his ABA programme.</li>
