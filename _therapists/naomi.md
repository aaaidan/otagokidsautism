After teaching in a primary school for six years in the US, I have come to very much enjoy working as a behaviour therapist here in Dunedin. It is both rewarding and challenging to educate, and guide children. Learning to address their individual needs and helping them to reach their potential is amazing work. I also enjoy establishing a trusting relationship with families in which we work together towards the same goals.

I have a Masters in Education from the University of California, Santa Cruz, and feel very fortunate to have made New Zealand my current home.
