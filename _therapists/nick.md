I have been an ABA therapist in Dunedin since July 2011. I love working with such an incredible team helping the children reach their goals. Getting to work one-on-one with the kids is truly awesome and tailoring a different approach to suit each personality is a challenge I relish.

I have a degree in psychology and also hold a diploma in counselling. I look forward to developing my skills and knowledge further and to continue into post graduate study in future.

My fiancé and I have two young children that keep me busy at home and I wouldn’t have it any other way.
