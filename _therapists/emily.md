I enjoy working with children, they never cease to amuse and surprise you. Keeping up with 3-10 yr olds requires lots of energy so i keep fit with running and boxing (but not with the kids). Iâ€™m a firm believer in positive reinforcement and fun in learning.

Last year I became the case manager for ABA in Dunedin. But I still get to spend most of my time doing sessions with the kids. I also recently had a professional development trip to Perth, where I made links with other case managers from around the world.

I have an honours degree in science, as well as a postgraduate certificate in counselling and a certificate in individual, group and organisational psychodynamics.

Currently I'm having a year off for maternity leave.
