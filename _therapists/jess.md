I am currently based in Oamaru and I’m working as an ABA therapist both in Oamaru and Dunedin. I have always had a natural affinity with children and consider myself lucky to be able to work with so many incredible kids. I’m learning something new from them every day and I am finding it to be such a rewarding experience. My job is amazing!
