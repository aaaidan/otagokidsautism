I enjoy being a behaviour therapist as I love children. I enjoy finding out what makes each and every one of them the wonderful individual that they are. Every child has their own unique thing to teach us and I enjoy learning from them as I help them achieve their own personal goals. I am current studying psychology and neuroscience at the University of Otago. I hope to one day qualify as a clinical psychologist so I can keep helping children achieve their potential.
